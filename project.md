## Stopwatch TDD style!

**The aim of this project is to create a stopwatch using the Red-Green-Refactor testing cycle we have been using over the last few days**

Previously created Stopwatches from Founders and Coders for inspriration  
[Stopwatch 1](http://vanillasquad.github.io/day-night-stopwatch/)  
[Stopwatch 2](http://vanillasquad.github.io/stopwatch-jack-elias/)  
[Stopwatch 3](http://olot.github.io/stopwatch/)  
[Stopwatch 4](http://fourloops.github.io/StopwatchFO/)  

#### What Functionality Does Our Stopwatch Need?
  * Counder should be at Zero when we start
  * Start Counting time from a specific point
  * Stop Counting
  * Continue Counting
  * Re-set the counter to Zero
  
#### Folder/File Structure
  * /spec contains the tests
  * /lib contains Jasmine
  * /src contains code for the stopwatch
  * index.html contains the stopwatch itself
  * style.css contains any custom styling you may want to apply
